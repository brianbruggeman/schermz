## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our software seriously. If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability within our application or an upstream dependency, please help us by submitting a change request.

### For Compromised Upstream Dependencies

If you discover a vulnerability in one of our upstream dependencies:

1. Check if the issue has already been reported to the upstream project.
2. If not already reported, please report it directly to the upstream project.
3. Once the upstream project has addressed the issue, please submit a change request to our project to update the dependency.

### For Vulnerabilities Within Our Project

If you discover a vulnerability directly within our project's code:

1. Do not open an issue; instead, submit a change request with a clear description of the problem and a suggested fix, if possible.
2. If you're not sure how to fix the issue, simply submit a change request with a detailed report of your findings.

### What to Include in a Change Request

- A clear and descriptive title.
- A comprehensive description of the issue.
- Affected versions of the project.
- Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable).
- Possible implications of the vulnerability.
- Potential solutions or mitigating factors (if any).

## Policy

We are committed to working with the community to verify and respond to these sorts of problems in a timely manner. If you have any security concerns that you believe need immediate attention, you can also reach out to our project maintainers for assistance.
